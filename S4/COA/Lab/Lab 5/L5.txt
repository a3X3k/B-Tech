Lab - 5
-------------------------- 


1. Construct a solid rectangle with '*' using MIPS assembly language. Get the length and breadth from the user. (Hint :Use jump/conditional branching)
Eg: Length = 6, breadth = 2

2.Write a program in MIPS assembly language to swap two values. Get input from the user and display the values on screen after swap operation. 

3. How can we implement logical not? Write down the statement and show the result. (Hint :  Use NOR)

4. Write a program that reads two integer numbers A and B. The program must indicate if one of these numbers is multiple of the other one.

5. Run the following code in QtSPIM.
	a. Comment the following code and find its C equivalent. 
	b. State the addressing mode and instruction type for each instruction in the given code. 
	c. Explain branch instruction  (bne) in detail with respect to the given code's PC values.
